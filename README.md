# Gender-Representation-Video-Games

## In this project my group and I decited to examine three datasets that involved various elements of gender representation in different video games, we wanted to investigate how we could increase gender representation in video games. To do that we began by investigating the average reviews of each game and the sexualization of each character in each game because we felt that those two variables would be at least moderatly positivly correlated. However, because our data was seperated into three different dataframes we had to figure out a way to merge all three before we could run any analysis. We were able to start by concatonating the sexualization dataset with the characters dataset on the 'ID' column and then joined that to the games dataframe by creating a data dictionary that included each 'Game_Id' with the sexualization of each game and then converting that dictionary into a dataset. We then were able to concationate the games dataset to the newly converted dictionary on the 'Game_Id' column to create the final dataset for our analysis. To analyze the correleation of each variable in the dataset we decided it would prudent to create a heat map. From that we were able to discover that sexualization and average reviews weren't nearly as correlated as we initially thought. This finding was shocking to us and caused us to question how sexuality was calculated. It also inspired us to shift our focus to two variables that had a better correlation, the number of females integrated on the design teams and the number of non male protagonists in these various games. We then conducted a single variable linear regression to predict the number of non male protagonists based on the number of female team integrints only to discover that the linear regression wasn't a great predictor because the coefficient of determination was still significantly below one so we wanted to explore how the data would fare in a logistic regression instead. In conducting the logistic regression we decided it would be more accurate of a predictor if we added more of the variables from the dataset to the x variable we created. So we included the 'female_team', 'Avg_Reviews', 'Protagonist', 'Relevant_males', 'Relevant_no_males', 'PEGI', and 'Sexualization' variables to our predictor element and our final model had an 87% accuracy rate of being able to predict the number of non male protagonists, with the 'Protagonist', 'Relevant_males', 'Relevant_no_males', and 'Sexualization' variables making the largest impact on the model.
